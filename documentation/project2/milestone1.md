# Project 2, Milestone 1 - Proposal

[NEXT MILESTONE](milestone2.md)

## Proposal

I want to continue working on my to-do list app that I created in Project 1 and improve the user experience through improved interactions with the to-do items and adding user authentication so that users have the choice of using the "free-for-all" guest account instead of making their own private to-do list.

New technologies:

- Firebase user authentication

## MVP Functions

- [ ] Make the page keyboard tabbable for accessibility
- [ ] Add user authentication using Firebase authentication
- [ ] Scroll to input box after entering a new todo
- [ ] Improve user experience by moving completed to-do items to the bottom of the page

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Improve responsive layout
- [ ] Add animations for funsies
