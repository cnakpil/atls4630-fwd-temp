# Project 2, Milestone 2

This project has been undeniably rough. On the bright side, I've successfully made my app more accessible as now all the buttons can be tabbed through via keyboard. On the not so bright side, I got stuck in a loop trying to figure out why I couldn't import firebase through TypeScript. I've actually wasted a little too much time on that issue and therefore, it has been pushed to the stretch goal section. I will fix it eventually, but it might happen when I fully switch over to the react/webpack/typescript meta.

I am refocussing on my actual MVP functions to improve the user experience, if not paring them down and moving more items into the stretch goal section. I find that I often dream a little bigger than I can actually complete. Keeping flexible on which items are actually MVP items allows me to mitigate my initial scope creep and temper my expectations.

If I can get my app to be tabbable for accesibility and have user authentication, it might just be good enough.

The rest can come later.
