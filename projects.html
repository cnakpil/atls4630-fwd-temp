        <h2>Class Portal</h2>
        <p>
          I challenged myself to design and develop a class portal to
          consolidate all assignments, projects, and documentation in one
          place. The portal is a good representation of my current design and
          web development skills, utilizing vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. It has
          a large landing page with seperate pages for both assignments and
          projects, using flex boxes to establish layout while keeping the
          site responsive.
        </p>
        <p>This site is the portal!</p>

        <h2>To Do List</h2>
        <p>
          I designed and developed a to-do list using Google Firebase and
          TypeScript, both technologies that I have not used before. I was
          mostly inspired by other online to-do apps like Google Keep, but
          also my own internal dialogue when I have to motivate myself to get
          things done. The intended audience is anyone who uses an online app
          to keep track of things they need to do. But also who might need a
          little tough love to get going.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this was my first attempt to figure out TypeScript, this is a terribly written app held together with
          figurative hot glue and duct tape.
          As it is a horrid amalgamation of JS and TS being used in a way they were never meant to be used together, it
          is currently broken. Please see Project 4 for the React version.</p>

          Combine the modular React.js/TS/FireBase app with SASS styling to get the effect I originally
